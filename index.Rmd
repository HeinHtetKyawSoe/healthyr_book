## Why read this book {-}

It is very important...

## Structure of the book {-}

Chapters \@ref(introduction) introduces a new topic, and ...

## Software information and conventions {-}

I used the **knitr**\index{knitr} package [@xie2015] and the **bookdown**\index{bookdown} package [@R-bookdown] to compile my book. My R session information is shown below:

```{r}
xfun::session_info()
```

Package names are in bold text (e.g., **rmarkdown**), and inline code and filenames are formatted in a typewriter font (e.g., `knitr::knit('foo.Rmd')`). Function names are followed by parentheses (e.g., `bookdown::render_book()`).

## Acknowledgments {-}

A lot of people helped me when I was writing the book.

## Installation {-}



```{block}
* Download R 
```

https://www.r-project.org/

```{block}
* Install RStudio
```

https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/

```{block}

* Install packages (copy these lines into the Console in RStudio):
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")

install.packages("gapminder")

install.packages("gmodels")

install.packages("Hmisc")

install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("ewenharrison/finalfit")

install.packages("pROC")

install.packages("survminer")

```

```{block}
When working with data, don't copy or type code directly into the Console. We will only be using the Console for viewing output, warnings, and errors (and installing packages as in the previous section). All code should be in a script and executed (=Run) using Control+Enter (line or section) or Control+Shift+Enter (whole script). Make sure you are always working in a project (the right-top corner of your RStudio interface should say "HealthyR").
```

```{r, out.width = "5cm", echo = FALSE}
