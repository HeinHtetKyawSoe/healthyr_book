## Why read this book {-}

> We are drowning in information but starved for knowledge.

John Naisbitt

In this age of information, the manipulation, analysis and interpretation of data has become paramount. 
Nowhere more so than in the delivery of healthcare. 
From the understanding of disease and the development of new treatments, to the diagnosis and management of individual patients, the use of data and technology is now an integral part of the business of healthcare. 

Those working in healthcare interact daily with data, often without realising it. 
The conversion of this avalanche of information to useful knowledge is essential for high quality patient care. 
An important part of this information revolution is the opportunity for everybody to become involved in data analysis. 
This democratisation of data analysis is driven in part by the open source software movement â€“ no longer do we require expensive specialised software to do this. 

The statistical programming language, R, is firmly at the heart of this! 

This book will take an individual with little or no experience in data analysis all the way through to performing sophisticated analyses. 
We emphasise the importance of understanding the underlying data with liberal use of plotting, rather than relying on opaque and possibly poorly understand statistical tests. 
There are numerous examples included that can be adapted for your own data, together with our own R packages with easy-to-use functions. 

We have a lot of fun teaching this course and focus on making the material as accessible as possible. 
We banish equations in favour of code and use examples rather than lengthy explanations. 
We are grateful to the many individuals and students who have helped refine these and welcome suggestions and bug reports via https://github.com/SurgicalInformatics.

## Structure of the book {-}

Chapters \@ref(introduction) introduces a new topic, and ...

## Software information and conventions {-}

I used the **knitr**\index{knitr} package [@xie2015] and the **bookdown**\index{bookdown} package [@R-bookdown] to compile my book. My R session information is shown below:

```{r}
xfun::session_info()
```

Package names are in bold text (e.g., **rmarkdown**), and inline code and filenames are formatted in a typewriter font (e.g., `knitr::knit('foo.Rmd')`). Function names are followed by parentheses (e.g., `bookdown::render_book()`).

## Acknowledgments {-}

A lot of people helped me when I was writing the book.

## Installation {-}



```{block}
* Download R 
```

https://www.r-project.org/

```{block}
* Install RStudio
```

https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/

```{block}

* Install packages (copy these lines into the Console in RStudio):
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")

install.packages("gapminder")

install.packages("gmodels")

install.packages("Hmisc")

install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("ewenharrison/finalfit")

install.packages("pROC")

install.packages("survminer")

```

```{block}
When working with data, don't copy or type code directly into the Console. We will only be using the Console for viewing output, warnings, and errors (and installing packages as in the previous section). All code should be in a script and executed (=Run) using Control+Enter (line or section) or Control+Shift+Enter (whole script). Make sure you are always working in a project (the right-top corner of your RStudio interface should say "HealthyR").
```

```{r, out.width = "5cm", echo = FALSE}
