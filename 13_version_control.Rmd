# Version control{#chap13-h1}
\index{version control@\textbf{version control}}

Version control is essential for keeping track of data analysis projects, as well as collaborating. 
It allows backup of scripts and easy collaboration on complex projects. 
RStudio works really well with Git, an open source open source distributed version control system, and GitHub, a web-based Git repository hosting service. 

\index{version control@\textbf{version control}!Git and Github}

Git is piece of software which runs locally. 
It may need to be installed first. 

It is important to highlight the difference between Git (local version control software) and GitHub (a web-based repository store). 

## Setup Git on RStudio and associate with GitHub

In RStudio, go to Tools -> Global Options and select the **Git/SVN** tab. 
Ensure the path to the Git executable is correct. 
This is particularly important in Windows where it may not default correctly (e.g. `C:/Program Files (x86)/Git/bin/git.exe`).

## Create an SSH RSA key and add to your GitHub account
\index{version control@\textbf{version control}!SSH RSA key}

In the **Git/SVN** tab, hit *Create RSA Key* (Figure \@ref(fig:chap13-fig-ssh)A). 
In the window that appears, hit the *Create* button (Figure \@ref(fig:chap13-fig-ssh)B). 
Close this window.

Click, *View public key* (Figure \@ref(fig:chap13-fig-ssh)C), and copy the displayed public key (Figure \@ref(fig:chap13-fig-ssh)D).

If you haven’t already, create a GitHub account. 
On the GitHub website, open the account settings tab and click the SSH keys tab (Figure \@ref(fig:chap13-fig-github)A). 
Click *Add SSH key* and paste in the public key you have copied from RStudio Figure \@ref(fig:chap13-fig-github)B).

```{r chap13-fig-ssh, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Create an SSH key"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/chapter13/1.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

```{r chap13-fig-github, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Create a GitHub account and add your SSH key."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/chapter13/2.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

## Create a project in RStudio and commit a file
\index{version control@\textbf{version control}!Commit}

Next, return to RStudio and configure Git via the **Terminal** (Figure \@ref(fig:chap13-fig-globalsettings)A)).
Remember Git is a piece of software running on your own computer. 
This is distinct to GitHub, which is the repository website. 

We will now create a new project which we want to back-up to GitHub. 

In RStudio, click *New project* as normal (Figure \@ref(fig:chap13-fig-globalsettings)B).
Click *New Directory*.
Name the project and check *Create a git repository*.
Now in RStudio, create a new script which you will add to your repository.

After saving your new script (e.g. test.R), it should appear in the **Git** tab beside **Environment**.

Tick the file you wish to add, and the status should turn to a green ‘A’ (Figure \@ref(fig:chap13-fig-globalsettings)C). 
Now click *Commit* and enter an identifying message in Commit message (Figure \@ref(fig:chap13-fig-globalsettings)D).

> It is important to commit prior to linking the project and the GitHub repository. 

You have now committed the current version of this file to your repository on your computer/server. 
In the future you may wish to create branches to organise your work and help when collaborating.

```{r chap13-fig-globalsettings, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Configure Git global settings via RStudio and create a new project."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/chapter13/4.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

## Create a new repository on GitHub and link to RStudio project
\index{version control@\textbf{version control}!repository}

Now you want to push the contents of this commit to GitHub, so it is also backed-up off site and available to collaborators. 
In GitHub, create a *New repository*, called here myproject (Figure \@ref(fig:chap13-fig-newrepo)A).

You will now see the *Quick setup* page on GitHub. 
Copy the code below *push an existing repository from the command line* (Figure \@ref(fig:chap13-fig-newrepo)B).

```{r chap13-fig-newrepo, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Create a new repository (repo) on GitHub."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/chapter13/5.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Back in RStudio, paste the code into the **Terminal**. 
Add your GitHub username and password (important!) (Figure \@ref(fig:chap13-fig-link)A). 

You have now pushed your commit to GitHub, and should be able to see your files in your GitHub account.

\index{version control@\textbf{version control}!pull and push}

The **Pull** and **Push** buttons in RStudio will now also work (Figure \@ref(fig:chap13-fig-link)B).

To avoid always having to enter your password, copy the SSH address from GitHub and enter the code shown in Figure \@ref(fig:chap13-fig-link)c and D).

Check that the **Pull** and **Push** buttons work as expected (Figure \@ref(fig:chap13-fig-link)E).

Remember, after each Commit, you have to Push to GitHub, this doesn't happen automatically.
You are now done!

```{r chap13-fig-link, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Link RStudio project to GitHub repository."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/chapter13/6.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

## Clone an existing GitHub project to new RStudio project
\index{version control@\textbf{version control}!clone}

An alternative situation is where a project already exists on GitHub and you want to copy it (*clone*) to an RStudio project. 

In RStudio, click *New project* as normal. Click *Version Control* and select *Git*.

In *Clone Git Repository*, enter the GitHub repository URL as per Figure \@ref(fig:chap13-fig-clone)C). 
Change the project directory name if necessary.

As above, avoid repeatedly having to enter passwords follow the steps in Figure \@ref(fig:chap13-fig-clone)D and E. 

```{r chap13-fig-clone, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Clone a GitHub repository to an RStudio project."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/chapter13/7.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```
