# (PART) Data wrangling and visualisation {-}
# Why we love R - TODO

TODO:

* R for Reproducibility
* R for Reusing scripts - efficiency
* R is powerful (graphics, all the stats you can dream of, reports, websites, books)
* Getting started


## Help, what's a script

And what's RStudio?

```{r, out.width = "10cm", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio_vs_r.png")
```


## Your first R plots

TODO: Rework or remove this section.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width  = 5,
  fig.height = 3
)
```

In this session, we will create five beautiful and colourful barplots in less than an hour.
Do not worry about understanding every single word or symbol (e.g. the pipe - `%>%`) in the R code you are about to see. The purpose of this session is merely to

* gain familiarity with the RStudio interface:
    + to know what a script looks like,
    + what is the Environment tab,
    + where do your plots appear.

**Data**

Load the example dataset which is already saved as an R-Data file (recognisable by the file extension .rda or .RData):

```{r, message=F}
library(ggplot2)

source("1_source_theme.R")

load("global_burden_disease_long.rda")

```

After loading the datasets, investigate your Environment tab (top-right). You will see two things listed: `mydata` and `mydata2013`, which is a subset of mydata.


Click on the name `mydata` and it will pop up next to where your script is.
Clicking on the blue button is not as useful (in this session), but it doesn't do any harm either.
Try it.

```{r}

mydata %>% #press Control-Shift-M to insert this symbol (pipe)
  ggplot(aes(x      = year,
             y      = deaths_millions,
             fill   = cause,
             colour = cause)) +
  geom_col()



```


`ggplot()` stands for **grammar of graphics plot** - a user friendly yet flexible alternative to `plot()`.

`aes()` stands for **aesthetics** - things we can see.

`geom_()` stands for **geometric**.

### Exercise

Plot the number of deaths in Developed and Developing countries for the year 2013:

```{r, echo = FALSE}

mydata2013 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x      = location,
             y      = deaths_millions,
             fill   = cause,
             colour = cause)) +
  geom_col()

```



## Tidyverse packages: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, etc.

Most of the functions introduced in this book come from the tidyverse family (http://tidyverse.org/), rather than Base R. Including `library(tidyverse)` in your script loads a list of packages: ggplot2, dplyr, tidry, forcats, etc.


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/library_vs_package.png")
```

```{r , message=F}

library(tidyverse)

```
