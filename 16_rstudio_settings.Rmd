# RStudio settings, good practise

## Starting with a blank canvas

In the first session we loaded some data that we then plotted. 
When we import data, R stores it and displays it in the Environment tab.

It's good practice to restart R before commencing new work. This is to avoid accidentally using the wrong data or functions stored in the environment.  
Restarting R only takes a second!

* Restart R (Ctrl+Shift+F10 or select it from Session -> Restart R).

RStudio has a default setting that is no longer considered best practice. You should do this once:

* Go to Tools -> Global Options -> General and set "Save .RData on exit" to Never. 
This does not mean you can't or shouldn't save your work in .RData files. 
But it is best to do it consciously and load exactly what you need to load, rather than letting R always save and load everything for you, as this could also include broken data or objects.
